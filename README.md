# Helping-Hands

An in-depth analysis of poverty in developing nations was conducted, examining its evolution before and after the pandemic, leading to the proposal of a comprehensive solution in the form of a software application. Developed a Java-based donation system that serves as a vital link between NGOs and four essential sectors: education, healthcare, food supply, and transportation. Integrated these modules seamlessly by implementing workflows and work requests, ensuring the efficient flow of information, thus enabling timely assistance to the regions in need.
